The data been taken from the experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age range of 19-48 years.     
Each person performed six activities 
	-WALKING
	-WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	-WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	-SITTING
	-STANDING
	-LAYING  
wearing a smartphone to their waist.
Using the phone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were captured,  
  
For the derived dataset, the following signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.  

	-tBodyAcc-XYZ
	-tGravityAcc-XYZ
	-tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	-tBodyGyro-XYZ
	-tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
	-tBodyAccMag
	-tGravityAccMag
	-tBodyAccJerkMag
	-tBodyGyroMag
	-tBodyGyroJerkMag
	-fBodyAcc-XYZ
	-fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	-fBodyGyro-XYZ
	-fBodyAccMag
	-fBodyAccJerkMag
	-fBodyGyroMag
    -fBodyGyroJerkMag  

The variables that were estimated from these signals are mean() - mean value and std() - standard deviation.

Vectors obtained by averaging the signals using the angle() variable are:

	-gravityMean
	-tBodyAccMean
	-tBodyAccJerkMean
	-tBodyGyroMean
	-tBodyGyroJerkMean
